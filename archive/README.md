# Archived Applications

These directories contain earlier-generation Next.js apps that have been
superseded by the main application at `phoenix_territory_map/nextjs_space/`.

They are kept for reference only — **do not run or deploy**.

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `density_map/` | Standalone density-map viewer (functionality merged into main app) |
| `phoenix_density_clean/` | Clean rebuild of density map (functionality merged into main app) |

Archived per AGENTS.md Rule 1: archive only, never delete.
