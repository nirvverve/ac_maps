## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Fix Retention BEFORE Focusing on Growth (URGENT)
**Current Problem**: 85% customer churn is unsustainable  
**Target**: Improve to 25% retention Year 1, 35% by Year 2  
**Financial Impact**: Each 10-point retention improvement = $2.3M annual recurring revenue saved

**Actions**:
- Conduct exit interviews to understand churn drivers
- Implement customer success management program
- Establish retention-focused KPIs for all GMs
- Address service quality and communication issues

### 2. Assign Unassigned ZIP Codes (IMMEDIATE)
- Approve 19 ZIP code recommendations (see detailed report)
- Update Phoenix Branch Breakout document
- Communicate assignments to affected customers
- Ensure CRM/routing systems reflect new assignments

### 3. Validate Financial Model
- Re-run financial projections with actual account distributions
- Determine minimum viable branch size
- Consider tiered branch models (GM vs. SSP-led) for smaller branches
- Ensure Phase 1 branches are financially sustainable

### 4. Organizational Structure Adjustments
**Add**:
- Regional Customer Success Manager (supports multiple branches)
- Quality Assurance role
- Training & Development coordinator

**Reconsider**:
- Whether smallest branches (72-92 accounts) need full GM or can share resources
- Branch consolidation for Mesa East/Pinal and Central Scottsdale/PV

### 5. Market-Specific Strategies
- **High-Value Markets** (Scottsdale, PV): Premium service, concierge model
- **Growth Markets** (Southwest Valley): Capture new construction
- **Dense Urban** (Central PHX, Tempe): Efficient routing, volume model
- **Suburban** (Chandler, Gilbert): Family-focused, reliable service

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **The Real Problem**: 85% customer churn, not branch size. Reorganization is an opportunity to improve retention, but must be coupled with systematic improvements.

2. **Territory Gap**: 14% of accounts are in unassigned ZIP codes. This must be fixed immediately.

3. **Phased Approach Essential**: Wide variation in branch characteristics requires cautious rollout. Start with 3-4 branches, learn, adjust, proceed.

4. **Massive Opportunity**: At 0.63% market penetration with 236K potential customers, growth opportunity is enormous—but only after fixing retention.

5. **Financial Validation Needed**: Some branches may not be viable at current sizes without adjustments.

## ❓ Key Questions for Leadership

1. **Retention Deep Dive**: What resources are available for customer research and retention improvements? This is more urgent than the reorganization itself.

2. **Financial Thresholds**: What is the minimum viable branch size? Should branches below this be merged or use alternative models?

3. **Investment Budget**: Is there allocated budget for retention initiatives, CRM improvements, training? Expected ROI?

4. **Timeline Flexibility**: Is 2027-2028 timeline firm? Recommend prioritizing success over speed.

5. **Competitive Intelligence**: What do we know about why customers leave? How will reorganization address root causes?

---

**Recommendation**: Treat this as a **customer retention transformation** enabled by reorganization, not just a restructuring exercise. The 85% churn rate is the existential threat—branch structure is the opportunity to fix it.
