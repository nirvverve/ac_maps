# Phoenix Branch Reorganization Strategic Analysis
## Comprehensive Evaluation of Proposed 11-Branch Structure

**Prepared for:** National Swimming Pool Service Company  
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Analysis Period:** Current accounts + 5 years of historical terminations  

---

## Executive Summary

This strategic analysis evaluates the proposed reorganization of the large Phoenix branch into 11 smaller, specialized branches based on territorial ZIP code assignments. The analysis examined 1,481 current active accounts and 8,556 terminated accounts to assess the viability of the proposed structure, identify gaps, and recommend an optimal phased rollout sequence.

### Key Findings

| Metric | Value | Implication |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Overall Retention Rate** | 14.68% | **CRITICAL**: 85% customer churn indicates severe operational issues |
| **Accounts in Unassigned ZIPs** | 1,354 (14% of total) | Major gap in territorial planning requiring immediate attention |
| **Total Lost Annual Revenue** | $11.5M | Massive revenue opportunity from improving retention |
| **Average Market Penetration** | 0.54% | Enormous untapped market potential across all territories |

### Critical Recommendations

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Assign 19 unassigned ZIP codes to appropriate branches (detailed recommendations provided)
2. **Phase 1 Rollout (2026)**: Prioritize 3-4 branches with highest retention challenges and account density
   - Central PHX / South (Priority Score: 71.1)
   - Tempe / Chandler West (Priority Score: 54.4)
   - Glendale / West PHX (Priority Score: 53.8)
   - North Scottsdale (Priority Score: 52.4)
3. **Focus on Retention**: Primary success metric should be improving from 15% to 30%+ retention in first year
4. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure adequate staffing based on updated account volumes with ZIP assignments

## 1. Data Overview

### Data Sources Analyzed
- **Current Active Accounts**: 1,481 residential accounts with ZIP codes
- **Terminated Accounts**: 8,556 accounts terminated over past 5 years with ZIP codes and revenue data
- **Proposed Territory Plan**: 11 branches with ZIP code assignments from Phoenix Branch Breakout.docx
- **Organizational Structure**: Staffing and financial model from Phoenix Break Breakdown.xlsx

### Geographic Scope

---

## 2. Critical Gap Analysis: Unassigned ZIP Codes

### The Problem
**1,354 accounts (14% of total historical accounts) are located in 22 ZIP codes that are NOT assigned to any branch in the proposed territorial plan.** This represents a critical oversight that would result in:
- 206 current active accounts with no assigned branch
- 1,148 historical terminations unaccounted for in analysis
- Potential service disruptions during rollout

### Top Unassigned ZIP Codes by Account Volume

| ZIP Code | Total Accounts | Current Active | Terminated | City/Area |
|----------|---------------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| 85254 | 277 | 56 | 221 | North Scottsdale |
| 85028 | 156 | 23 | 133 | North Phoenix |
| 85032 | 131 | 13 | 118 | North Phoenix |
| 85248 | 105 | 22 | 83 | Chandler |
| 85257 | 95 | 14 | 81 | Scottsdale |
| 85212 | 82 | 15 | 67 | Mesa |
| 85388 | 82 | 13 | 69 | Surprise/El Mirage |
| 85024 | 77 | 10 | 67 | North Phoenix |
| 85353 | 69 | 5 | 64 | Surprise |

#### Branch 10: Mesa Central / Gilbert East (+82 accounts)
- **85212** (82 accounts) - Central Mesa area

**Note**: 2 ZIP codes require additional geographic review: 85317 and one unspecified code.

### Impact of Assignments

Adding these unassigned ZIP codes significantly changes branch account distributions:

| Branch | Current (Before) | Current (After) | Change | % Increase |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|--------|------------|
| North Phoenix I-17 | 89 | 135 | +46 | +52% |
| North Scottsdale | 131 | 195 | +64 | +49% |

## 4. Phased Rollout Recommendation

### Priority Scoring Methodology

Each branch was evaluated on four weighted factors:
- **40%** - Retention challenges (inverse of retention rate - branches with worse retention get higher priority)
- **30%** - Current account volume (critical mass for viable branch)
- **20%** - Revenue at risk (lost annual revenue from terminations)
- **10%** - Market potential (total addressable market)

### Phase 1: Initial Rollout (2026) - Top 4 Branches

| Rank | Branch Name | Priority Score | Current Accounts | Retention | Strategic Rationale |
|------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **1** | **Central PHX / South** | 71.1 | 174 | 13.59% | Largest account base, highest revenue at risk ($1.75M), covers dense urban core. Critical to address immediately. |
| **2** | **Tempe / Chandler West** | 54.4 | 170 | 16.80% | Second-largest account base, major East Valley market, relatively better retention provides foundation for success. |
| **3** | **Glendale / West PHX** | 53.8 | 134 | 13.48% | Major West Valley hub, high account density, significant lost revenue ($1.2M). |
| **4** | **North Scottsdale** | 52.4 | 195 | 16.13% | High-value market, largest branch after ZIP assignments, strategic importance for brand reputation. |

**Rationale for Top 4 Selection:**
- **Geographic Coverage**: Provides representation across North, Central, East, and West Valley
- **Account Volume**: Combined 673 current accounts (47% of total) ensures critical mass
- **Market Diversity**: Mix of affluent (Scottsdale), middle-market (Glendale), and dense urban (Central PHX)
- **Operational Learning**: Range of retention rates (13.6% to 16.8%) allows testing improvement strategies across different performance levels

### Phase 2: Secondary Rollout (2027) - Next 4 Branches

| Rank | Branch Name | Priority Score | Current Accounts | Strategic Rationale |
|------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **5** | **Southwest Valley / Laveen** | 52.3 | 125 | Fast-growing area, completes West Valley coverage |
| **6** | **Peoria / Surprise North** | 50.4 | 104 | WORST retention (11.01%), critical to address but after learning from Phase 1 |
| **7** | **Central Scottsdale / PV** | 41.8 | 92 | High-value market, can leverage learnings from North Scottsdale rollout |
| **8** | **North Phoenix I-17** | 41.1 | 135 | Completes North Phoenix coverage, benefits from adjacent branch learnings |

### Phase 3: Final Rollout (2027-2028) - Remaining 3 Branches

| Rank | Branch Name | Priority Score | Current Accounts | Strategic Rationale |
|------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **9** | **Mesa Central / Gilbert East** | 41.7 | 131 | Stable retention, can be addressed after East Valley foundation established |
| **10** | **Chandler / Gilbert South** | 40.0 | 149 | BEST retention (19.1%), can serve as model/control during earlier phases |
| **11** | **Mesa East / Pinal Outliers** | 27.5 | 72 | Smallest branch, geographic outlier, lowest priority |

### Alternative Rollout Strategy: Geographic Clustering

If operational efficiency is prioritized over retention challenges, consider:

**Phase 1A: West Valley Cluster**
- Glendale / West PHX
- Southwest Valley / Laveen
- Peoria / Surprise North

**Phase 1B: East Valley Cluster**
- Tempe / Chandler West
- Chandler / Gilbert South
- Mesa Central / Gilbert East

**Advantage**: Shared resources, reduced drive times during transition, easier cross-training  
**Disadvantage**: Delays addressing Central PHX/South (highest priority) and high-value Scottsdale markets

---

## 5. Organizational Structure Assessment

### Current State (Per Phoenix Break Breakdown.xlsx)

The organizational model shows:
- **Leadership**: GM + Customer Service Manager + Sr. Service Pro per branch
- **Repair Teams**: Dedicated repair pro per branch
- **Service Technicians**: ~11 service pros per pool (suggests ~45 accounts per technician at 495-pool West branch size)
- **Shared Services**: Finance, HR, IT centralized across 12 branches

### Key Gaps Identified

#### 1. Staffing Model Assumptions vs. Reality

The financial model assumes 495 pools per branch for the "West" example. However, actual account distributions vary significantly:

| Branch Cluster | Accounts per Branch | Staffing Implications |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Large Branches** (4, 1, 8) | 170-195 accounts | Need full GM + 4-5 technicians |
| **Medium Branches** (3, 6, 10, 7, 9, 5) | 104-149 accounts | Need GM + 3-4 technicians |
| **Small Branch** (2, 11) | 72-92 accounts | May need shared GM or SSP model |

**Recommendation**: The organizational model should be scaled by tier, with smaller branches potentially sharing management or operating under a Senior Service Pro model initially.

#### 2. Retention-Focused Roles Missing

Given the critical 85% churn rate, the organization structure lacks:
- **Customer Success/Retention Manager**: Dedicated role to monitor satisfaction, proactive outreach, and churn prevention
- **Quality Assurance**: No mention of QA role to ensure service consistency
- **Training & Development**: No dedicated training role for onboarding and continuous improvement

**Recommendation**: Add a Regional Customer Success Manager role to support multiple branches, especially in Phase 1 rollout.

#### 3. Branch Size Imbalance

Updated account volumes (with ZIP assignments) show significant imbalance:

- **Largest**: North Scottsdale (195), Central PHX/South (174), Tempe/Chandler West (170)
- **Smallest**: Mesa East/Pinal (72), Central Scottsdale/PV (92), Peoria/Surprise (104)

**Recommendation**: Consider further splitting large branches or consolidating small branches. For example:
- Central PHX/South (1,280 total historical accounts) might warrant splitting into Central PHX and South Phoenix
- Mesa East/Pinal could merge with Mesa Central/Gilbert East

#### 4. Geographic Span Concerns

Some territories cover vast geographic areas:
- **Branch 11** (Mesa East/Pinal Outliers): Spans from East Mesa to Casa Grande (50+ miles)
- **Branch 5** (Peoria/Surprise North): Large North Valley territory

**Recommendation**: Monitor drive times and non-billable hours. May need to adjust territories after initial rollout data.

### Financial Model Validation

The Phoenix Break Breakdown shows:
- **Revenue per Account**: ~$1,920 annual maintenance revenue (based on $950,400 / 495 pools)
- **Labor Costs**: 43.5% of revenue
- **COGS**: 43.3% of revenue
- **G&A + Marketing**: 14.1% of revenue
- **Target EBITDA**: Breakeven to slightly negative in model (-0.9%)

**Concerns**:
1. At 495 accounts, the model barely breaks even
2. Several proposed branches have fewer than 150 accounts
3. No margin for retention improvement investments
4. Shared services allocation assumes 12 branches, but plan shows 11

**Recommendation**: 
- Re-run financial model with actual account distributions
- Smaller branches may need higher AMR (average monthly revenue) or lower cost structure
- Consider tiered pricing for high-service areas (Scottsdale, Paradise Valley)
- Budget for retention improvement initiatives (should pay for themselves quickly given 85% churn)

## 6. Market Opportunity Analysis

### Current Market Penetration

Despite operating for years, market penetration is extraordinarily low across all territories:

| Branch | Current Accounts | Market Potential | Penetration % |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| North Scottsdale | 195 | 22,970 | 0.85% |
| Central Scottsdale / PV | 92 | 17,675 | 0.52% |
| North Phoenix I-17 | 135 | 18,769 | 0.72% |
| Central PHX / South | 174 | 28,591 | 0.61% |
| Peoria / Surprise North | 104 | 18,582 | 0.56% |
| Glendale / West PHX | 134 | 21,114 | 0.63% |
| Southwest Valley / Laveen | 125 | 18,485 | 0.68% |
| Tempe / Chandler West | 170 | 23,191 | 0.73% |
| Chandler / Gilbert South | 149 | 24,181 | 0.62% |
| Mesa Central / Gilbert East | 131 | 25,488 | 0.51% |
| Mesa East / Pinal Outliers | 72 | 17,589 | 0.41% |

**Total Market**: 236,635 pools  
**Current Penetration**: 1,481 accounts = **0.63%**

### Strategic Implications

1. **Massive Growth Potential**: Even reaching 5% market penetration (11,832 accounts) would represent 8x growth

2. **Competition Analysis Needed**: Low penetration suggests:
   - High competition from other service providers
   - Many homeowners self-maintain
   - Pricing or service model issues
   - Poor brand awareness/marketing

3. **Retention vs. Acquisition Balance**: 
   - Current problem: Acquiring customers but losing 85% of them
   - **Priority**: Fix retention BEFORE aggressive acquisition
   - A "leaky bucket" - pouring more water in doesn't help if the holes aren't fixed

4. **Market-Specific Strategies**:
   - **High-Value Markets** (Scottsdale, Paradise Valley): Premium service, concierge model
   - **Growth Markets** (Southwest Valley): Capture new construction
   - **Dense Urban** (Central PHX, Tempe): Efficient routing, volume model
   - **Suburban** (Chandler, Gilbert): Family-focused, reliable service emphasis

### Competitive Positioning

The reorganization provides opportunity to differentiate by:
- **Local Expertise**: "Your Scottsdale Pool Specialist" vs. generic large branch
- **Faster Response**: Smaller territories = quicker service calls
- **Relationship-Based**: Same techs, same route, build trust
- **Community Engagement**: Localized marketing, neighborhood presence

---

## 7. Critical Success Factors

### Primary Goal: Improve Customer Retention

**Current State**: 14.68% retention (85% churn)  
**Target**: 25% retention by end of Year 1, 35% by end of Year 2  
**Financial Impact**: Each 10-point improvement in retention = ~$2.3M annual recurring revenue saved

### Key Retention Drivers to Address

Based on analysis of terminated accounts:

1. **Service Quality Consistency**
   - With 8,556 terminations over 5 years, systemic issues are evident
   - Smaller branches enable better quality control and technician accountability

2. **Customer Communication**
   - Implement customer success management
   - Proactive outreach for at-risk accounts
   - Regular service updates and education

   - Build relationships and trust
   - Reduce "just another vendor" perception

5. **Problem Resolution Speed**
   - Local management can address issues faster
   - Empowered GMs to retain customers
   - Clear escalation paths

### Operational Metrics to Track

For each branch in rollout:

**Retention Metrics** (Primary)
- Month-over-month retention rate
- Churn reasons (categorized)
- Win-back rate for terminated accounts
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)

**Operational Metrics**

## 11. Conclusions & Next Steps

### Key Takeaways

1. **Territory Plan Needs Immediate Correction**: 22 unassigned ZIP codes representing 1,354 accounts must be assigned before rollout. Recommendations provided for 19 of these.

2. **Retention is the Critical Issue**: At 85% customer churn, the primary problem is not branch size or territory design—it's customer retention. The reorganization creates an opportunity to improve retention through localized management, but must be coupled with systematic retention improvements.

3. **Phased Approach is Essential**: The wide variation in branch sizes, retention rates, and market characteristics makes a cautious phased rollout critical. Start with 3-4 branches, learn, adjust, then proceed.

4. **Financial Model Requires Validation**: The organizational structure and financial projections need to be recalculated using actual account distributions. Some branches may not be viable at current size without higher AMR or lower costs.

5. **Massive Market Opportunity**: At 0.63% market penetration with 236,635 potential customers, the growth opportunity is enormous—but only if retention can be improved first.

### Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

1. **Review and approve ZIP code assignment recommendations** for the 19 unassigned ZIP codes
2. **Validate financial viability** of each proposed branch with updated account numbers
3. **Confirm Phase 1 branch selection** (recommend: Central PHX/South, Tempe/Chandler West, Glendale/West PHX, North Scottsdale)
4. **Launch customer research initiative** to understand root causes of 85% churn
5. **Begin GM recruitment/selection** for Phase 1 branches

### Strategic Questions for Leadership

1. **Retention Investigation**: What specific actions will be taken to understand and address why 85% of customers terminate? This is more urgent than the reorganization itself.

2. **Financial Thresholds**: What is the minimum number of accounts per branch for financial viability? Should branches below this threshold be merged or operate under a different model?

3. **Investment in Retention**: Is there budget allocated for retention improvement initiatives (customer success manager, CRM improvements, training, etc.)? What is the expected ROI?

4. **Market Penetration Strategy**: After stabilizing retention, what is the strategy to grow from 0.63% to 5%+ market penetration? How does the JV model factor in?

5. **Timeline Flexibility**: Is the 2027-2028 full rollout timeline flexible, or is there pressure to complete faster? Recommend prioritizing success over speed.

6. **Competitive Intelligence**: What do we know about why we're losing to competitors or self-maintenance? How will the reorganization address this?
