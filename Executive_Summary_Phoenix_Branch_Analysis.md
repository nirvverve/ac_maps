# Phoenix Branch Reorganization
## Executive Summary & Key Findings

**Prepared For:** Amenity Pool Services Executive Leadership  
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Analysis Scope:** 11-Branch Reorganization Plan Evaluation

---

## 🎯 Strategic Objective

Transform one large, inefficient Phoenix branch into 11 optimized branches to improve customer retention and operational efficiency in the Phoenix market (2026-2028 rollout).

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL FINDINGS - THE THREE DEAL-BREAKERS

### 1. ⚠️ MASSIVE COVERAGE GAP: 206 Active Accounts Unassigned
- **14% of entire customer base** not included in proposed branch plan
- ZIP 85254 alone: 56 accounts (largest concentration) - COMPLETELY MISSING
- **$330K annual revenue** falling through the cracks
- **Impact:** Service failures, customer confusion, revenue loss

### 2. 🚨 RETENTION CRISIS: 81% Churn Rate Across All Territories
- **Industry benchmark:** 15-25% annual churn
- **Phoenix reality:** ~81% cumulative churn over 4 years
- **Lost revenue:** $10.2M over 4 years (6,444 terminated accounts)
- **Impact:** Cannot scale a broken retention model

### 3. ⚙️ ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE: No Retention-Focused Roles
- Current plan emphasizes repair/remodel (revenue generation)
- **ZERO dedicated Customer Success/Retention roles** identified
- GM incentives tied to profitability only, not retention
- **Impact:** Will continue to lose 80%+ of customers even with new branches

### Highest Risk Branches:
1. **Branch 5 - Peoria/Surprise** (84 accounts, **86.3% churn**) - Worst retention, something broken
2. **Branch 7 - Southwest Valley** (112 accounts, 83.6% churn) - Large geography, high churn
3. **Branch 4 - Central PHX/South** (174 accounts, 82.9% churn) - Too large, needs split

### STRATEGIC:

**6. PHASED 3-YEAR ROLLOUT (Not All at Once)**
- **Phase 1 (2026):** Launch Branches 6, 1, 8 (3 branches, 480 accounts)

- Split into Branch 4A (Central) and 4B (South)

**8. IMPLEMENT SERVICE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY**
- Jobber, ServiceTitan, or similar platform
- Automated routing, customer portal, quality tracking
- **Investment:** $60K implementation + $25-35K/year per branch

**9. CREATE RETENTION INVESTMENT BUDGET**
- **Year 1:** $255K (analysis, technology, pilot programs, training)

## 💡 THE BOTTOM LINE

### ✅ **Should You Proceed with Branch Reorganization?**

**YES, BUT NOT AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED.**

The branch reorganization strategy is sound in principle - smaller, localized branches can deliver better service and retention. However, the current plan has critical gaps that will undermine success.

### The Choice:

**Option A: Fix First, Then Scale (RECOMMENDED)**
- 6-month "Fix It" period to address retention crisis
- Fix territory gaps and org structure
- Pilot proven retention model
- 3-year phased rollout starting April 2026
- **Outcome:** High probability of success

**Option B: Scale Current Model (HIGH RISK)**
- Launch branches immediately with current plan
- 11 branches all experiencing 80%+ churn instead of 1
- Continued revenue hemorrhaging at larger scale
- **Outcome:** High probability of failure

### **Final Recommendation:**

**Proceed with reorganization following the "Fix First, Then Scale" approach with all critical recommendations implemented.**

**The data is unambiguous: You cannot scale an 81% churn operation and expect different results. Fix retention first, THEN scale the solution.**

**This is a $10M+ problem that requires a $4M solution. The alternative is continued decline.**
