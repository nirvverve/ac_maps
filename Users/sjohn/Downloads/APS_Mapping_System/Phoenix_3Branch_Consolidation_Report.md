## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation and recommendation for consolidating Phoenix's proposed 11-territory structure into 3 branches (West, Central, East) for the Year 1 rollout beginning in 2026. The consolidation achieves exceptional balance across all key operational metrics while maintaining geographic logic and supporting the organization's primary objective of improving customer retention.

### Key Findings

**✓ Optimal Balance Achieved**
- **West Branch:** 491 accounts (-0.5% from target)
- **Central Branch:** 473 accounts (-4.2% from target)
- **East Branch:** 514 accounts (+4.1% from target)
- All branches within ±5% of target, representing near-perfect distribution

**✓ Retention Improvement Opportunity Identified**
- East Branch shows best retention: 20.01% (79.99% churn)
- West Branch shows lowest retention: 17.50% (82.50% churn)
- 2.5 percentage point improvement opportunity by applying East's best practices to West

**✓ Geographic Logic Maintained**
- Clear territorial boundaries minimize service area overlap
- Logical grouping of adjacent zip codes reduces travel time
- Flexibility built in for outlier territories

## 4. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Immediate Actions for Year 1 Rollout

#### 1. **Launch Sequence: East → West → Central**

**Phase 1: East Branch (Q1 2026)**
- **Rationale:** Best retention performance provides strong foundation
- **Risk:** Low - Proven success patterns to replicate
- **Account Base:** 514 accounts (largest, most stable)
- **Geographic Advantage:** Highest density (18.4 accounts/zip) enables efficient operations
- **Quick Win:** Demonstrate immediate retention improvement

**Phase 2: West Branch (Q2-Q3 2026)**
- **Rationale:** Greatest improvement opportunity (lowest retention)
- **Risk:** Moderate - Can apply learnings from East launch
- **Account Base:** 491 accounts (balanced size)
- **Geographic Challenge:** Larger territory (44 zips) requires robust routing
- **Success Metric:** Target 2+ percentage point retention improvement by applying East best practices

**Phase 3: Central Branch (Q4 2026)**
- **Rationale:** Most complex territory benefits from mature processes
- **Risk:** Moderate - Most zip codes (50) and diverse geography
- **Account Base:** 473 accounts (smallest, most manageable)
- **Geographic Complexity:** Includes outlier territories requiring flexible approach
- **Advantage:** Learns from both previous launches

#### 2. **Retention Improvement Initiatives**

**Study and Replicate East Branch Success Factors:**
- Analyze service delivery patterns in East (Scottsdale/Chandler/Gilbert)
- Identify key drivers of 20% retention vs. 17.5% in West
- Potential factors to investigate:
  - Service technician consistency
  - Customer communication frequency
  - Response time to service issues
  - Demographic and property characteristics
  - Pricing and contract structure differences

**West Branch Retention Focus:**
- Target: Improve from 17.50% to 19.50%+ (East benchmark)
- Impact: Saving ~50+ accounts annually = ~$81,000 in retained revenue
- Specific areas of concern:
  - Peoria/Surprise North (86.32% churn) - highest in portfolio
  - Southwest Valley/Laveen (83.17% churn)

**Central Branch Optimization:**
- Address high average lost revenue per account ($1,699)
- Focus on outlier territories (Mesa East/Pinal) for customized retention strategies
- Leverage learnings from East and West to optimize from launch

#### 3. **Operational Structure Recommendations**

**Branch Staffing (Balanced Approach):**
- Target: 1 service technician per 120-130 accounts for optimal workload
- **West:** 4 technicians (122 accounts each)
- **Central:** 4 technicians (118 accounts each)
- **East:** 4 technicians (128 accounts each)

**Branch Management:**
- Each branch requires dedicated Branch Manager
- Shared support functions (dispatch, customer service) during first year
- Path to independent operations by Year 2

**Service Territory Design:**
- Maintain zip code integrity within each branch
- Consider sub-territories within branches for efficient routing
- East: 2 sub-territories (North Scottsdale, Tempe/Chandler/Gilbert)
- West: 2 sub-territories (Northwest Valley, Southwest/Mesa)
- Central: 2 sub-territories (Central/North Phoenix, Scottsdale/Outliers)

### B. Risk Mitigation

#### Geographic Complexity Risks

**Risk:** Branch 10 (Mesa Central) assigned to West creates non-contiguous territory
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Clear routing protocols to minimize cross-territory travel
  - Consider as "flex territory" that could shift to Central if operational challenges arise
  - Monitor first 6 months for efficiency issues

**Risk:** Branch 11 (Outliers) in Central includes distant Pinal County areas
- **Mitigation:**
  - Designate specialized service days for outlier zip codes
  - Consider partnering with local service providers for emergency calls
  - Evaluate viability after Year 1 - may become separate micro-branch in future

#### Customer Communication Risks

**Risk:** Customers may experience confusion during transition
- **Mitigation:**
  - Communicate changes 60+ days before transition
  - Emphasize continuity of service, not disruption
  - Introduce new technicians to existing customers before full handoff
  - Maintain customer hotline for transition questions

#### Retention Impact Risks

**Risk:** Transition disruption could temporarily worsen retention
- **Mitigation:**
  - Offer transition incentives (e.g., one free service, price lock)
  - Prioritize high-value customers for extra attention
  - Monitor weekly retention metrics during transition
  - Rapid response team for at-risk accounts

### C. Performance Monitoring Framework

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) by Branch

**Retention Metrics (Primary Success Measure):**
- Monthly retention rate
- Quarterly churn rate
- Customer tenure analysis
- Reason for cancellation tracking

**Operational Efficiency Metrics:**
- Average service time per account
- Travel time between accounts
- Same-day service completion rate
- Technician utilization rate

**Financial Metrics:**
- Revenue per account
- Cost to serve per account
- Lost revenue from terminated accounts
- Retention program ROI

**Comparative Benchmarks:**
- East Branch = Retention benchmark (20%+)
- Industry standard = 30-40% retention (aspirational)
- Year 1 Target = 22%+ retention across all branches

#### Reporting Cadence

- **Weekly:** Operational metrics (service completion, utilization)
- **Monthly:** Retention and churn analysis
- **Quarterly:** Comprehensive branch performance review
- **Annual:** Strategic assessment and Year 2 planning

**Moderate Scenario: +2.5% Retention Improvement (Achieve East benchmark)**
- Accounts saved: ~37 per branch = 111 total
- Annual revenue retained: ~$183,000
- 3-year cumulative value: ~$549,000

**Optimistic Scenario: +5% Retention Improvement**
- Accounts saved: ~74 per branch = 222 total
- Annual revenue retained: ~$366,000
- 3-year cumulative value: ~$1,098,000

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
