## Notable Assignment Differences

### Geographic Optimization vs. Troy's Operational Assignment

| Employee | Home City | Troy's Assignment | Geographic Rec. | Distance Impact |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Michael Grant | Phoenix (85021) | Commercial | West | Commercial spans metro |
| Matthew Halteman | Tucson | Tucson | East | Tucson leadership role |
| Thomas Rau | Tempe | Commercial | Phoenix | Commercial spans metro |
| Joan Magana-Chavez | Surprise | Central | West | ~5-10 mi difference |
| Alexander Widom | Tempe | Central | East | ~5-10 mi difference |

**Analysis:** Most assignments align well with geography. Differences are primarily due to:
1. **Commercial division** requires metro-wide coverage (not tied to specific office)
2. **Leadership roles** (e.g., Matthew Halteman leading Tucson operations)
3. **Operational needs** (e.g., balancing team sizes and expertise)
