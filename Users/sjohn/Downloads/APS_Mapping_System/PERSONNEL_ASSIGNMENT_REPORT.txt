EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
====================================================================================================

This analysis examines how existing service routes and technicians align with the new four-branch 
structure (West, Central, East, and Tucson). The goal is to understand personnel reassignment 
requirements and identify which technicians can remain in their current assignments versus those 
who will require significant route changes.

KEY FINDINGS:

Total Accounts Analyzed: 1,674
Total Active Technicians: 32

TECHNICIAN ALIGNMENT BREAKDOWN:

• Fully Aligned (100% of accounts in one territory):     13 technicians (40.6%)
  → These technicians can be assigned directly with NO route changes

• Mostly Aligned (80-99% in one territory):              10 technicians (31.2%)
  → These technicians can be assigned with MINIMAL route adjustments

• Mixed Territory (50-79% in one territory):              9 technicians (28.1%)
  → These technicians require SIGNIFICANT route restructuring

• Highly Fragmented (<50% in any single territory):       0 technicians (0.0%)
  → These technicians have accounts spread across multiple territories

IMPLEMENTATION IMPACT:

✓ LOW IMPACT: 23 technicians (71.9%) can transition smoothly
⚠ MEDIUM-HIGH IMPACT: 9 technicians (28.1%) require careful planning

2. ROUTE REASSIGNMENT VOLUME:

   Accounts requiring reassignment to different technicians:

   - Estimated accounts needing new technician assignment: 226

3. UNASSIGNED ACCOUNTS:

   Accounts currently marked as "Unassigned": 41
   These will need to be distributed among technicians in their respective territories.


====================================================================================================
NEXT STEPS & RECOMMENDATIONS
====================================================================================================

1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
   
   ✓ Review the "Technician Summary" tab in the Excel workbook for complete details
   ✓ Examine individual territory tabs for branch-specific assignments
   ✓ Identify technicians willing to change territories (especially Mixed Territory cases)

2. PLANNING PHASE:

   a) For Fully Aligned technicians (13 total):
      → Confirm their assignment to their natural territory
      → No route changes required
   
   b) For Mostly Aligned technicians (10 total):
      → Identify the 20% of accounts that need reassignment
      → Transfer those accounts to other technicians in the appropriate territories
   
   c) For Mixed Territory technicians (9 total):
      → CRITICAL: Make strategic decisions on each technician
      → Option 1: Assign to primary territory and reassign other accounts
      → Option 2: Consider splitting large routes if geographically feasible
      → Option 3: Evaluate technician preferences and skills

3. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:

   Phase 1: Assign all Fully Aligned technicians (23 technicians, ~40% of workforce)
   Phase 2: Resolve Mostly Aligned technicians and redistribute their minor accounts
   Phase 3: Make strategic decisions on Mixed Territory technicians
   Phase 4: Assign unassigned accounts to appropriate technicians
   Phase 5: Balance workloads across technicians within each branch
