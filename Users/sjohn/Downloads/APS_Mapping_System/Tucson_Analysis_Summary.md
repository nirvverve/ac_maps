# Tucson Branch Decentralization Analysis - Summary

## Analysis Completed: October 23, 2025

---

## Critical Findings

### 🚨 **Major Discovery: 78.9% of Accounts Are Unassigned**

The proposed 2-branch plan only covers **21.1% of the actual account base**. The most significant gap:

- **Casa Grande represents 44.0% of all accounts (483 accounts)** but is completely absent from the plan
- This is not a peripheral market - it's the single largest account concentration
- Casa Grande alone has more accounts than both proposed Tucson branches combined

### 📉 **Retention Crisis: 21.6% Overall**

Both proposed branches show critically low retention:
- **Branch 1 (East & North):** 25.00% retention
- **Branch 2 (West & Central):** 18.55% retention
- Multiple ZIP codes have 0% retention (all accounts terminated)

---

## Proposed Territory Performance

### Branch 1 - Tucson East & North (Foothills)
- **Coverage:** 8 ZIP codes in high-value Catalina Foothills area
- **Accounts:** 27 active, 81 terminated (108 total)
- **Retention:** 25.00%
- **Revenue:** $52,278 annual
- **Assessment:** Better retention, but still critically low

### Branch 2 - Tucson West & Central (Urban & Growth)
- **Coverage:** 11 ZIP codes in Northwest, West Side, and central areas
- **Accounts:** 23 active, 101 terminated (124 total)
- **Retention:** 18.55%
- **Revenue:** $44,496 annual
- **Assessment:** Larger territory, lower retention - needs intensive intervention

## Top Strategic Recommendations

### 1. **Address Casa Grande Immediately (Priority 1)**
Casa Grande cannot be ignored:
- **Recommendation:** Create a separate 3rd branch for Casa Grande
- **Alternative:** Explore partnership/franchise model for the area
- **DO NOT assign to Tucson branches** - 60 miles away defeats decentralization purpose

### 2. **Fix Retention Before Decentralizing (Priority 1)**
21.6% retention indicates fundamental operational problems:
- Root cause analysis of terminated accounts
- Competitive analysis and service quality improvements
- Customer reactivation programs in high-potential ZIP codes
- Consider delaying Branch 2 launch until retention improves

### 3. **Assign Remaining Tucson ZIP Codes (Priority 2)**
Several Tucson-area ZIP codes need assignment:
- 85746, 85747, 85756, 85757 → Branch 1 (East proximity)
- 85735, 85739, 85713 → Branch 2 (West proximity)
- Marana (85653, 85658) → Branch 2 (Northwest proximity)
- Vail (85641, 85706) → Branch 1 (Southeast proximity)

### 4. **Phased Implementation**
- **Phase 1 (Q1 2026):** Complete territorial planning + retention improvement initiative
- **Phase 2 (Q2-Q3 2026):** Launch Branch 1 first (higher retention baseline)
- **Phase 3 (Q4 2026):** Launch Branch 2 + Casa Grande solution
- **Phase 4 (2027):** Optimization and peripheral market expansion

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISKS
1. **Retention crisis (21.6%)** - Decentralization alone won't fix operational issues
2. **Casa Grande unaddressed (44% of accounts)** - Massive strategic gap
3. **Zero-retention ZIP codes** - May require market re-entry strategy
4. **Branch 2 low retention (18.55%)** - High risk of failure at launch

### MEDIUM RISKS
1. **Incomplete coverage** - Peripheral Tucson ZIP codes unassigned
2. **Branch 2 resource needs** - Larger territory with worse baseline performance

## Success Metrics & Targets

**Current Baseline:** 21.6% retention  
**Target Milestones:**
- 6 months: 35% retention
- 12 months: 50% retention
- 24 months: 65%+ retention

## Key Comparison: Tucson vs Casa Grande

| Metric | Tucson (Assigned) | Casa Grande (Unassigned) | Ratio |
|:-------|------------------:|-------------------------:|------:|
| Total Accounts | 232 (21%) | 483 (44%) | **2.1:1** |
| Active Accounts | 50 | 103 | **2.1:1** |
| % of Total Database | 21% | 44% | **2.1x larger** |

**Casa Grande is more than twice the size of the proposed Tucson territories combined.**

---

## Conclusion

The proposed 2-branch Tucson split is geographically sound but **critically incomplete**. The analysis reveals:

1. ✅ The geographic split between East/North and West/Central makes sense
2. ✅ Branch balance is reasonable (46.6% vs 53.4%)
3. ❌ Only covers 21% of the account base
4. ❌ Casa Grande's absence is a critical strategic error
5. ❌ 21.6% retention indicates deeper operational problems

**Bottom Line:** This reorganization must be part of a comprehensive turnaround strategy, not just a territorial restructuring. Casa Grande must be addressed, and retention improvements must be implemented in parallel with decentralization.
