TERRITORY UPDATE SUMMARY - ZIP ADDITIONS & DENSITY FIX
================================================================================

Date: November 24, 2025

================================================================================
1. NEW ZIP CODE ADDITIONS
================================================================================

Two zip codes have been added to the territory mapping:

  ✓ ZIP 85218 → East Territory (APS of Chandler)
    Location: Apache Junction area
    Active accounts: 1
    Impact: Resolved 1 previously unassigned account

  ✓ ZIP 85004 → Central Territory (APS of Scottsdale)
    Location: Phoenix (Downtown)
    Active accounts: 0 (currently)
    Impact: Prepared for future expansion in downtown Phoenix

================================================================================
2. DENSITY ANALYSIS - ISSUE RESOLVED
================================================================================

Problem Identified:
  The density-data.json file had an incorrect structure that prevented
  the density views from displaying data properly.

Root Cause:
  • File used 'zip' instead of 'zipCode'
  • File used 'territory' instead of 'area'
  • Missing fields: activeCount, terminatedCount, totalHistorical, churnRate

Solution Implemented:
  ✓ Regenerated density-data.json with correct structure
  ✓ Loaded both active and terminated account data
  ✓ Calculated churn rate for each zip code
  ✓ Mapped all 161 zip codes with account history

Density Views Now Working:
  ✓ Active Accounts View - Shows current account density (green scale)
  ✓ Terminated Accounts View - Shows terminated account density (red scale)
  ✓ Churn Rate View - Shows retention performance (green to red scale)
