## 🔍 Key Findings Summary

### The Critical Issue: Customer Retention
- **Current Retention Rate:** 14.75% (85% churn!) ⚠️
- **Lost Annual Revenue:** $11,505,900
- **Root Cause:** Service delivery issues, not just branch size
- **Recommendation:** Fix retention BEFORE focusing on growth

### The Territory Gap: Unassigned ZIP Codes
- **22 ZIP codes** are not assigned to any branch
- **1,354 accounts** (14% of total) affected
- **19 recommendations** provided for immediate assignment
- **Action Required:** Update Phoenix Branch Breakout document

### The Opportunity: Market Potential
- **236,635 pools** in total addressable market
- **0.63% current penetration** (only 1,481 accounts)
- **Massive growth potential** once retention is fixed
- **Focus:** Fix the "leaky bucket" before adding more water

### The Solution: Phased Rollout
**Phase 1 (2026)** - Top 4 Branches:
1. Central PHX / South (Priority: 71.1)
2. Tempe / Chandler West (Priority: 54.4)
3. Glendale / West PHX (Priority: 53.8)
4. North Scottsdale (Priority: 52.4)

These 4 branches cover 673 accounts (47% of total) with geographic diversity.

## 🎯 Critical Recommendations Recap

### 1. Fix the Territory Plan (IMMEDIATE)
22 unassigned ZIP codes must be assigned before rollout. See recommendations in Excel file.

### 2. Focus on Retention (URGENT)
85% churn is the existential threat. Reorganization is the opportunity to fix it, but requires:
- Customer research to understand churn drivers
- Retention-focused KPIs for all GMs
- Customer success management program
- Service quality improvements

### 3. Validate Financial Model
Some branches have fewer than 100 accounts. Ensure they're financially viable or consider:
- Tiered branch models (GM vs. SSP-led)
- Branch consolidations where needed
- Adjusted pricing for high-service areas

### 4. Phase the Rollout
Don't try to do all 11 branches at once. Start with 3-4, learn, adjust, then proceed.

### 5. Market Penetration After Retention
At 0.63% penetration, the growth opportunity is massive—but only after fixing the 85% churn rate.

## ❓ Questions & Clarifications

### About the Analysis:
This analysis is based on:
- **1,481 current active accounts** from Residential Data for Phoenix.xlsx
- **8,556 terminated accounts** from Terminated Contract Data for Phoenix.xlsx (past 5 years)
- **11 proposed branches** from Phoenix Branch Breakout.docx
- **Organizational structure** from Phoenix Break Breakdown.xlsx

### Key Assumptions:
- ZIP codes (not current territory/route) determine future branch assignment
- Retention rate calculated as: Current Accounts / (Current + Terminated)
- Priority scoring uses 40% retention challenges, 30% account volume, 20% revenue risk, 10% market size

### What Was NOT Analyzed:
- Current operational costs by territory (limited data available)
- Competitive landscape and pricing analysis
- Specific reasons for customer terminations (no data available)
- Route efficiency and drive times
- Technician performance metrics

### If You Need:
- **Clarifications on methodology:** See full report Section 2-3
- **Different analysis cuts:** All data is in CSV files for custom analysis
- **Presentation materials:** Use HTML visualizations and executive summary
- **Implementation details:** See full report Sections 9-10
