# ✅ Tucson Branch Decentralization Analysis - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Analysis Overview

I've completed a comprehensive strategic analysis of the Tucson branch decentralization plan, mirroring the approach used for Phoenix. The analysis evaluates the proposed 2-branch territory reorganization against actual account data.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL DISCOVERY

### **The proposed plan covers only 21% of actual accounts!**

**Casa Grande, which is NOT mentioned in the 2-branch proposal, represents 44% of all accounts in the database - more than both proposed Tucson branches combined.**

This is not a minor oversight - it's a fundamental gap in the strategic plan that must be addressed immediately.

## 📊 Key Metrics

### Overall Portfolio
- **Total Accounts:** 1,097
- **Active:** 236 (21.6%)
- **Terminated:** 861 (78.4%)
- **Overall Retention:** 21.6% (critically low)

### Proposed Branches (Cover only 232 of 1,097 accounts)

**Branch 1 - Tucson East & North (Foothills)**
- 8 ZIP codes covering affluent East Side/Foothills
- 27 active, 81 terminated (108 total)
- 25.00% retention
- $52,278 annual revenue

**Branch 2 - Tucson West & Central (Urban & Growth)**
- 11 ZIP codes covering West Side/Northwest growth areas
- 23 active, 101 terminated (124 total)
- 18.55% retention (concerning)
- $44,497 annual revenue

### Unassigned Territories (865 accounts - 78.9% of total!)

**Casa Grande (85122 + other CG ZIPs): 483 accounts (44% of database)**
- 103 active, 380 terminated
- 21.3% retention
- Geographic distance: ~60 miles from Tucson

**Other Unassigned Markets:**
- Maricopa: 105 accounts
- Casa Grande satellite ZIPs: 61 accounts
- Coolidge: 49 accounts
- San Tan Valley: 59 accounts
- Plus 15 additional peripheral ZIP codes

## 🎯 Top 4 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. **Address Casa Grande Immediately (CRITICAL)**
**Recommendation:** Create a separate 3rd branch for Casa Grande
- Represents 44% of all accounts
- Too large and too distant to assign to Tucson branches
- Should be treated as a separate market opportunity

**Alternatives:**
- Partnership/franchise model
- Assign temporarily to nearest branch (NOT recommended due to distance)

### 2. **Fix Retention Crisis Before Decentralizing**
21.6% retention indicates fundamental operational problems:
- Root cause analysis of terminated accounts
- Service quality improvements
- Competitive analysis
- Customer reactivation programs
- **Consider delaying launches until retention improves**

### 3. **Complete Territory Assignments**
Multiple Tucson-area ZIP codes need assignment:
- **To Branch 1:** 85746, 85747, 85756, 85757, Vail area
- **To Branch 2:** 85735, 85739, 85713, Marana area
- This adds ~50 more accounts to the coverage

### 4. **Phased Implementation Strategy**
- **Q1 2026:** Complete planning + launch retention improvement
- **Q2-Q3 2026:** Launch Branch 1 (higher retention baseline)
- **Q4 2026:** Launch Branch 2 + Casa Grande solution
- **2027:** Optimization and expansion

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISKS
1. **Retention crisis (21.6%)** - Decentralization won't fix underlying problems
2. **Casa Grande unaddressed (44%)** - Massive strategic gap
3. **Branch 2 low retention (18.6%)** - May fail at launch
4. **Multiple zero-retention ZIP codes** - Market reputation may be damaged

### MEDIUM RISKS
1. Incomplete Tucson coverage (peripheral ZIPs unassigned)
2. Branch 2 larger territory with worse baseline performance

## 📈 Success Targets

**Current:** 21.6% retention  
**Targets:**
- 6 months: 35%
- 12 months: 50%
- 24 months: 65%+

## 💡 Bottom Line

**The Tucson 2-branch geographic split is sound, but the plan is critically incomplete.**

✅ **What's Working:**
- Geographic split makes sense (East/North vs West/Central)
- Branch balance is reasonable
- Focuses on high-density Tucson metro area

❌ **Critical Issues:**
- Only covers 21% of account base
- Casa Grande (44% of accounts) completely omitted
- 21.6% retention requires immediate attention
- Several Tucson peripheral ZIPs unassigned

**Recommendation:** This must be treated as a comprehensive turnaround strategy, not just territorial reorganization. Casa Grande decision is urgent, and retention improvements must happen in parallel with decentralization.
