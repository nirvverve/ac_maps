## Branch Size Distribution

The three branches are **NOT equal in size**, as requested:

| Area | Active Accounts | % of Total | Size Category |
|------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| **East** | 685 | 41.8% | Largest |
| **Central** | 596 | 36.3% | Medium |
| **West** | 360 | 21.9% | Smallest |

**Rationale for Unequal Distribution:**
- East Area has the **lowest churn rate** (77.53%) and **highest retention rate** (22.47%)
- Geographic spread in East Area requires more accounts to maintain operational efficiency
- Integration of Tucson peripheral areas naturally increases East Area size
- West Area's smaller size allows for focused retention improvement efforts
